It is to be feared that the efforts occasionally made to intro-
duce a systematic and rigid economy into the Royal expenses
were scarcely more effectual. In 15:25, soon after the Queen
Dowager and the Douglases‚ had taken the place of Albany in
the government of the Kingdom and the custody of the young
King, We find it recorded in the Books of Parliament, that
‘⁶ Robert Bertoun of Ovirberntoun comptroller schew how the
expense of the Kingis houshald is risin sa gret that his propirtie
may nocht beir the samin, and daly apperis to rise gretar becaus
na ordour is put therto be the lordis havand auctoritie of the
samin3 certifying to the lordis forsaid, that without thai pro-
uidit sum gud ordour and reule to his houshald it 15 nocht possi-
ble that his Grace may be sustenit to his honour as efferis.’'

Numerous regulations followed in that Parliament regarding
the form of the Royal Household‚ and the persons who should
compose it; and it 15 probable that to this period, and to the
same Comptroller‚ is to be ascribed the commencement of the
separate formal Record of the expenses of the Royal House-
hold 3 at least we have no evidence of its existence of an earlier
date than 1116 commencement of the imperfect series of volumes
which still exist, extending from 1525 10 1553.
