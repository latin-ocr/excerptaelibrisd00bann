In the list of the‘SEA F isn, which constituted the chief supply, the Her-
ring occupies a prominent place, whether in a fresh or salted state, from
the West or East coast 3 while, contrary to what is generally supposed,
the. Red Herring‚ Alleca rubea, was not unknown in those days.

Many kinds of White fish appear to be referred to, as Mulones re-
centes and Mulones aridi, terms by which the Cod seems to have been
designated ; while the other allied kinds are specified under the terms
albi pisces, Ware codlings, Podlokis, Codlinges‚ Merlingis, merlingz's
estivale-3, uthis, and Leing, in addition to stockfish, speldings, and
pisces aridi.

The F lat fish, under the terms turbontes, Holibut, Rones, Turb0t‚
Bronoscopi (Ui-anoscopi ?)‚ Flounders, seem to have been liberally sup-
plied, and occasionally the Sole. No reference is made to the Skate,
unless we are to consider the fish in common use in a recent and dried
state under the term Rigadia, as of that sort.

Many other kinds of sea-fish are frequently referred to, as Sandoels,
Fundolis ; Blennies, Greenbans ; Gurnards‚ Crunans ; Lump-fish,
Padils ,- Angler, Murlzeon ,- Sea-cat, Cattus marinus. The Spirling,

Conger Eel, and Lamprey, have likewise a place, while Bffjfiscloe, a
term of frequent occurrence, is of very doubtful import.

At the head of the fresh-water fish must be placed the Salmon‚ as
having been extensively employed in a fresh and salted state, and as
kipper. Trouts, too, under the terme Truttis, Truttis tom-entim,—
Ιηι]ῑιεανηφη,-φηανῑ”).’ί and magni, together with Eels, Perch, and Pike,
frequently find a place. The occurrence of the Pike in the list of fish

purchased in 1595, is in oppositi( n to tlte generally received opinion,
