The original Record, though carefully and even elaborately
written, is so full of the solecisms of an illiterate scribe, that any
attempt at correcting them must have changed the character of
the book. The text is therefore to be considered as a literal
transcript of the Record.

There is subjoined to this Notice a communication to the
Editor by Professor Fleming, of King's College, Aberdeen‚
containing some notes upon the subjects of Natural History
occurring in the volume. These must derive much authority
and value from that gentleman’s well-known character as a
Naturalist.

The List of ternis which follows, is intended to collect into
one view all the articles of entry that occur in the book, and
where possible, to explain such of them as are either of rare
occurrence or occur in an unusual shape or sense. It has been
prepared by Mr Kilgour, the gentlenian who made the selec-
tions from the record.

The vignette on the title page is from a carving formerly
on the roof of one of the apartments of the house of R‘Iary of
Guise in the Castlehill, Edinburgh. The arms are those of
Scotland impaled with Lorraine.

It may be mentioned that another member of the Bit-Numi:
CLUB proposeS‚ in a separate volume, to continue this series of
extractS, so far at least as to include the years of the successive
marriages of J ames the Fifth.
