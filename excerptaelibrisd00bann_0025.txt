With the exception of Lai-ks, which are occasionally referred to,
the list os land birds is thus limiteil. The catalogue of XVATER FoWL
is more extensive.

Among the Waders, the Heron is occasionally recorded under the
names Herle, Ardea, and Ciconia. Though the latter term might
seem to refer to the Stork, it is to be observed that several of the dates
of purchase do not accord with the migrations of that bird. The
Crane, grus, is likewise occasionally referred to. Grues plurimi is a
phrase employed by Lesley in reference to this bird as a denizen of
scotland.

While, as might have been expected, Woodcoeks, Plovers, Snipes,
and Redshanks, occupy a place in the catalogue, Dotterels are likewise
notieed as having been obtained, as at present, in the spring, on their

passage to the breeding-ground.

The common Duck and Goose, domesticated and wild, oecnpy a
prominent place among the water-fowL-—the latter, however, iu the
greatest abundance3 with occasionally SwanS, Teals, Claclce's or Berna-
cle, and Sheldrake‚ together with Auce Solares, by which Solan Geese
are probably referred to.

The FISHES employed at the Royal table appear to have been numer-
ous in point of species, but they are expressed in the entries in such
terms as to render mere conjectural attempts at a correct nomenclature
of very little value. On this account, it seems unnecessary to do more
than refer to a few of the ternis, remarkable as indicating the extent

and regularity of the supply, or the singular kinds selected for the

table.
